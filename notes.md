# Notes of Ester, thoughts, everything.

This is gonna be messy.

Okay let's start with part 1.
create an app
create the model
create the view.
test it.

Install latest python 3.12.4

poetry install

poetry run django-admin startapp energy

source it's a TextChoice

csv data.

Model created.

Let's make the factory first.
and a silly test.

Think the energy consumption must been associate with a user... that would make sense.

okay now to the view

and think the timestamp-user must be unique. in order to not repeat inserting records...
